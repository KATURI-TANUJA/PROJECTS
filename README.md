# PROJECTS
• Heart Rate Detector [09/2022 - 02/2023]  
Tech Stack: C Language 
Developed a device which detects the heart rate of the patient 
in emergency situations and send an alert to the hospital, 
family and friends when the heart rate goes abnormal, also 
shares current GPS location with the ambulance. 


 
• Ultra Sonic Radar System [03/2023 - 07/2023]  
Tech Stack: C Language 
The aim of this project is to achieve a radar system prototype 
based on an Arduino board, which detects stationary and moving 
objects. It is a system that uses Ultrasonic sensors to detect, 
locate, and track objects such as aircrafts, ships, weather patterns, 
and even satellites.



• APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE 
Tech Stack: Python Language            [03/2024 - 07/2024] 
This project aims to create an interactive API BOT using Gemini 
API. It helps to design and develop an innovative bot that leverages 
the power of Python libraries like Selenium and Gradio. It is 
designed to simulate conversation with users and can be integrated 
into WhatsApp or as a standalone website resembling WhatsApp 
AI, prioritizing user interaction and experience.
